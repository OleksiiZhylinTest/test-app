# Velocity

## Purpose

Velocity measures how much work a team completes in each sprint, expressed in story points.
It is the most widely used leading indicator of team throughput: a stable or rising velocity
means the team is delivering predictably, while sudden drops or spikes signal disruption,
scope changes, or estimation drift.

This metric answers the core planning question: *"How many story points can we expect this
team to deliver in the next sprint?"*

## Use Cases

- **Sprint planning** — use the average of the last 3–5 sprints as the team's capacity target.
- **Trend analysis** — spot sustained improvement (e.g. after adopting new practices) or
  decline (e.g. after team restructuring or technical-debt accumulation).
- **Predictability assessment** — high variance sprint-to-sprint suggests unreliable estimation
  or frequent scope changes.
- **Capacity comparison** — compare velocity across teams or time periods (normalised to team
  size) to inform staffing decisions.
- **AI adoption impact** — use alongside the AI Assistance Trend metric to assess whether
  AI tooling correlates with higher throughput.

## Report Availability

| Report format | Available |
|---|---|
| HTML report | yes — bar chart with running average line |
| Markdown report | yes — ASCII bar chart + data table |

## Required Jira Fields

| Logical key | Default Jira field ID | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `story_points` | `customfield_10016` | number | Must be set on each issue; issues with no value count as 0 points |
| `status` | `status` | string | Used to identify completed issues |
| `sprint` | `customfield_10020` | array | Groups issues by sprint |

The `story_points` field ID varies by Jira instance. Set it on the active schema in
`config/jira_schema.json` (via the UI's *Jira Field Schema* card or by editing that file).
If the file is missing, the app uses a built-in default schema (same default ID as Jira Cloud).

Done statuses are configurable in the schema's `status_mapping.done_statuses` list (defaults:
`Done`, `Closed`, `Resolved`, `Complete`).

## Required Configuration

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `JIRA_SCHEMA_NAME` | _(unset)_ | CLI-only fallback (`python main.py`). UI runs use the active filter's `params.schema_name` from `config/jira_filters.json`, which overrides this env var via `/api/generate`. |
| `JIRA_SPRINT_COUNT` | `10` | Number of past sprints fetched and displayed |
| `JIRA_BOARD_ID` | _(first board)_ | Scopes sprint and issue fetch to a specific board |

Story points and other field IDs always come from the active schema (file or built-in default).

## Calculation

1. **Fetch sprints** — retrieve the last `JIRA_SPRINT_COUNT` sprints for the board.
2. **Fetch issues** — for each sprint, retrieve all issues assigned to it.
3. **Attribute each ticket to a single sprint** — applied in this priority order:
   1. **By `resolutiondate`** — if the ticket's resolution date falls within some sprint's
      `[startDate, endDate]` window, it is attributed to that sprint, even if Jira's sprint
      field for the ticket does not include it. This ensures that work which closed during
      the active sprint counts toward the active sprint, not toward a closed sprint the
      ticket was carried over from.
   2. **By most-recent membership** — otherwise, the ticket is attributed to the most recent
      sprint (by `startDate`) where Jira's API returned it. This handles tickets without a
      resolution date and tickets resolved outside any tracked sprint window.

   Both rules work together to (a) prevent double-counting when Jira returns the same ticket
   for multiple sprints, and (b) prevent retroactive inflation of a closed sprint's velocity
   by tickets that actually completed later.
4. **Filter to done issues** — keep an issue if either (a) its `status.name` (lowercased) is
   in the configured `done_statuses` set, or (b) it has a non-empty `resolutiondate` field.
   The fallback (b) supports kanban boards with custom terminal status names (e.g. `Released`,
   `Deployed`) that are not enumerated in `done_statuses`.
5. **Sum story points** — add up the `story_points` field value for each done issue.
   Issues with a missing or non-numeric value contribute 0.
6. **Record per sprint** — store `velocity` (rounded to 1 decimal place) and `issue_count`
   (number of done issues) for each sprint.

**Formula:**

```
velocity(sprint) = Σ story_points(issue)  for all issues where status ∈ done_statuses
```

Where "issue is done" follows the rule from step 4 above (status match or `resolutiondate`
fallback).

No weighting, averaging, or normalisation is applied within a single sprint. The HTML report
overlays a running average line for visual trend interpretation.

## Estimation Type

The velocity metric adapts to the configured estimation type (`ESTIMATION_TYPE` env var or
UI radio button):

| Mode | `velocity` value | Unit label |
|---|---|---|
| `StoryPoints` (default) | Sum of story points for done issues | "points" |
| `JiraTickets` | Count of done issues (`issue_count`) | "issues" |

When `JiraTickets` is active, `build_metrics_dict()` post-processes velocity rows by setting
`velocity = issue_count` for each sprint. The underlying `compute_velocity()` function always
computes both `velocity` (points) and `issue_count`; the estimation type only changes which
value is surfaced as the primary velocity number.

Report column headers adjust automatically (e.g. "Velocity (issues)" instead of
"Velocity (points)").

## Recommendations

- **Estimate all issues** — velocity is meaningless if a large share of issues have no story
  points. Enforce estimation as a team norm during sprint planning.
- **Use a rolling average** — a single sprint's velocity is noisy. For planning, average the
  last 3–5 sprints.
- **Don't compare across teams directly** — story-point scales differ per team. Use velocity
  as a self-comparison tool within one team over time.
- **Investigate outlier sprints** — a sprint with unusually high or low velocity warrants
  a quick check: were there holidays, carry-over issues, or an estimation re-calibration?
- **Watch issue count alongside points** — a sprint can show high velocity by completing many
  small issues. If `issue_count` is unusually high, check whether large stories are being
  split artificially to inflate the number.
- **Align done statuses with your workflow** — if your board uses custom status names (e.g.
  `Shipped`, `Accepted`), add them to `status_mapping.done_statuses` in the schema; otherwise
  those issues will be excluded from velocity.

## Developer / AI Copilot Notes

**Module:** `app/core/metrics.py`

**Primary function:**
```python
def compute_velocity(
    sprints: list[dict],
    sprint_issues: dict[int, list[dict]],
    story_points_field: str | None = None,
    done_statuses: frozenset[str] | None = None,
) -> list[dict]:
    ...
```

**Output shape (one item per sprint):**
```python
{
    "sprint_id": int,
    "sprint_name": str,
    "start_date": str | None,   # ISO-8601 or None
    "end_date":   str | None,   # ISO-8601 or None
    "velocity":   float,        # story points, rounded to 1 dp
    "issue_count": int,         # number of done issues
}
```

**Location in `metrics_dict`:** `metrics["velocity"]` — a list ordered by the input `sprints` list.

**Helper functions used:**
- `_get_story_points(issue, story_points_field)` — extracts the numeric field value, returns `0.0` on missing/invalid.
- `_is_done(issue, done_statuses)` — returns True if `fields.status.name` (lowercased) is in `done_statuses`, or if `fields.resolutiondate` is set (kanban fallback for custom terminal status names).
- `_resolve_schema_params(schema)` — pulls `story_points_field` and `done_statuses` from the active schema dict.

**Extending velocity:**
- To count issues instead of summing points, set `ESTIMATION_TYPE=JiraTickets` (env var or UI
  radio). `build_metrics_dict()` already overwrites each row's `velocity` with its `issue_count`
  in that mode — see the **Estimation Type** section above. No code change required.
- To add a new "done" status, update `status_mapping.done_statuses` in the schema JSON — no code
  change required.
- To add velocity to a new report format, consume `metrics["velocity"]` from the dict returned by
  `build_metrics_dict()`.

**Test factory:** use `make_sprint()` and `make_issue()` from `tests/conftest.py`.

```python
from tests.conftest import make_sprint, make_issue
from app.core.metrics import compute_velocity

sprint = make_sprint(1, name="Sprint 1")
issues = {1: [make_issue("PROJ-1", status="Done", points=5)]}
result = compute_velocity([sprint], issues)
assert result[0]["velocity"] == 5.0
```
