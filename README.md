# AI Adoption Metrics Report

Fetches data from Jira Cloud and generates AI adoption and velocity trend reports in HTML and Markdown (in parallel).

## Setup

### Before you begin — where to extract the application

Extract the ZIP to a **permanent folder that you own**, for example:

- `C:\Users\<your-username>\Apps\AIMetrics`
- `C:\Apps\AIMetrics`

**Avoid** these locations:

| Location | Why |
|---|---|
| `Downloads\` | Often cleaned automatically; easy to delete by accident |
| `Desktop\` | Synced by OneDrive/SharePoint on many corporate machines — large files slow sync |
| `C:\Program Files\` | Requires administrator rights to write |

> **Your data is safe across upgrades.** Credentials, reports, filters, DAU data, and certificates are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AIMetrics` — completely outside the application folder. Upgrading means unzipping a new version anywhere and running it; your data migrates automatically on first launch.

### Step 1 - Install Python, dependencies, and bootstrap config (run once)

Double-click **`project_setup.bat`**.

This will:

- Detect or install Python 3.12 (per-user, no admin rights needed)
- Create a `.venv` virtual environment
- Install all required packages from `requirements.txt`
- Optionally install dev dependencies (`pytest`, linters, etc.) and the Playwright Chromium browser (required for e2e tests)
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` when `.env` is missing
- Prompt to keep or back up and recreate `.env` when it already exists

### Step 2 - Configure Jira credentials

Open `.env` and fill in:

- `JIRA_URL` – e.g. `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`
- `JIRA_EMAIL` – your Atlassian account email
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN` – create at [Atlassian API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

That is all that `.env` needs. Non-sensitive settings (`JIRA_BOARD_ID`, `JIRA_SPRINT_COUNT`, `JIRA_SCHEMA_NAME`, AI labels, metric toggles, etc.) live in `config/defaults.env` — edit that file to change project-wide defaults.

## Run

### Using the browser UI (recommended)

Double-click **`start_app.bat`** — this starts a local server bound to `127.0.0.1` and opens the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

Use the UI to configure your Jira connection, select a filter, and generate reports. On the **Filter Builder** tab, pick an **Active Schema** before saving a filter — the saved filter's `schema_name` determines which schema the pipeline uses when the filter is run. Select an existing filter from the **Filter Name** dropdown to load it into the form for in-place editing, or pick `— New filter —` to create one from scratch.

If your Jira instance uses a custom CA certificate, use the Jira Connection tab to fetch it or place the PEM bundle at `certs/jira_ca_bundle.pem`.

### Managing schemas

The **Schema Setup** tab (between *Jira Connection* and *Filter Builder*) is an editor for the Jira field schemas stored in `config/jira_schema.json`. Pick a schema from the dropdown to load its full JSON body into the editor, tweak `schema_name`, `fields`, or `status_mapping`, and click **Save** — saves upsert by `schema_name`. Click **New Schema** to start from a blank template; **Delete** removes any non-default schema (`Default_Jira_Cloud` is always preserved). The Schema Setup tab does not choose the schema used for report generation — that is determined by the selected filter's `schema_name` on the Filter Builder tab. For CLI-only runs (`python main.py`), `JIRA_SCHEMA_NAME` in `config/defaults.env` is used as a fallback.

## Troubleshooting

### Port 8080 already in use

If the server fails to start because port 8080 is occupied by a stale previous instance:

**Quick fix — use a different port:**

Open `config/defaults.env` (or add to `.env` to override) and change the `PORT` line:

```
PORT=9000
```

Then restart the server and open `http://localhost:9000` in your browser.

Alternatively, pass the port directly on the command line (overrides `.env`):

```bash
python server.py 9000
```

**Kill the stale process (Windows):**

1. Find the PID holding port 8080:
   ```
   netstat -ano | findstr :8080
   ```
   The last column is the PID.

2. Kill it:
   ```powershell
   # PowerShell - kill by PID
   Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force
   
   # Kill all Python processes
   taskkill /IM python.exe /F
   
   # Kill by window title
   taskkill /FI "WINDOWTITLE eq *server.py*" /F
   
   # Or in PowerShell:
   Stop-Process -Name python -Force
   ```
   ```cmd
   :: Command Prompt
   taskkill /PID <PID> /F
   ```

3. Restart the server normally.

## Release process

This project uses semantic version tags and a GitHub release workflow.

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   version = "1.0.0"
   ```
2. Commit the bump:
   ```bash
   git add pyproject.toml
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.0"
   git push origin master
   ```
3. Push the matching release tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

The release workflow validates the code, builds `ai_adoption_manager_v1.0.0.zip`,
and creates a GitHub Release with the ZIP attached.
